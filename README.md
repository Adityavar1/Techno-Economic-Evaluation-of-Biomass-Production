Economic analysis involves checking the economic practicability of a process, which helps track expansion, and investment. Bio-oil and its properties differ considerably depending on the Biomassfeedstock structure, residence time, temperature.The production cost of bio-oil through fast Pyrolysis isthe critical factor for evaluating the market compatibility with other
biofuels available. The cost can be affected by different pretreatments, upgrading processes, and recycling techniques. The temperature rangesfrom 500 to 600 0C produces a higher bio-oil yield, reducing overall production cost
